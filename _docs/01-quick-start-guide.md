Minimal Mistakes has been developed as a [Jekyll theme gem](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) for easier use. It is also 100% compatible with GitHub Pages --- just with slightly different installation process.

## Installing the Theme

If you're running Jekyll v3.5+ and self-hosting you can quickly install the theme as a Ruby gem.
